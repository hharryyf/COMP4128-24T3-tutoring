Problem A: Simple and naive for COMP1511. I believe all of you can solve it as long as you understand the spec.

Problem B: Find the maximum length first, then think about how to construct the maximum sum. Some techniques we used for the first tutorial problem "Substring Removal Game" might be useful.

Problem C: You can first calculate the total number of 0s and total number of 1s. Then, you should immediately realize that once you fix 
the total number of 01s, the total number of 10s should be fixed (think why). Constructing a sequence using 0 and 1 with a fixed number of 01 subsequence 
can be done greedily.

Problem D: Think about the ILP method of solving the first tutorial question last week, you can formulate this problem to an ILP. How to solve the ILP can be 
done greedily. A similar problem is https://codeforces.com/gym/104114/problem/N which you can solve it in your free time.

Problem E:
